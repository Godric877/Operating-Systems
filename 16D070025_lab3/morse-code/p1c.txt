When the sleep time for the child is greater than the grandchild, first the grandchild exits and send the SIGCHLD signal
to the child which handles the signal by printing the required output. Then, the child exits and sends the SIGCHLD signal
to the parent which also handles the signal appropriately.

However, when the sleep time for the child is lesser than the grandchild, the child exits first and sends the SIGCHLD signal 
to the parent who handles it correctly by printing the required output to the screen. However, since the child process has exited
the grandchild gets allocated the init process as the parent due to which the default handler of the init process handles the SIGCHLD 
signal of the grandchild and no output is printed to the screen.
