1) r stores the address to be freed. First r->next is pointed at the head kmem.freelist and then the 
   head kmem.freelist is pointed at r. These steps result in the new page being added at the beginning of the 
   linked list.

2) PDX(va) has the first ten bits of the va. pde contains the address of the page directory entry at the index given by PDX(va).
   PTE_ADDR extracts the first twenty bits of *pde which contains the physical address of the page table. p2v translates the address
   into virtual address	and pgtab contains the base address of the page table. PTX(va) extracts the next ten bits of the virtual address and pgtab[PTX(va)] is the page table entry at the index given by PTX(va). Finally, the address of the page table entry is returned.
